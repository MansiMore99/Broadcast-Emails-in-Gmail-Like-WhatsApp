**Here’s how Google saved me (again) from a time-consuming task! 😅**

My employer asked me to send an email to over 800 recipients listed in an Excel sheet. 📊 Each email needed to include a personalized name and employee ID, but the rest of the content was exactly the same.

Manually sending all those emails? 🧑‍💻

No way. 🙅‍♂️🙅‍♀️ 

That would’ve taken forever. ⏳


**With the right tools, what seemed like a huge task turned into a smooth and simple process. To send personalized emails from Gmail using data in an Excel sheet, you’ve got two main options:**

Gmail’s built-in Mail Merge with Google Sheets: Super handy and totally free.
Third-party tools like Yet Another Mail merge YAMSS or Mergo Mail Merge: Great if you want extra features like tracking or scheduling.

## Gmail’s Mail Merge with Google Sheets:

**Prepare your data:**
Organize your email recipients and their personalized information in a Google Sheets spreadsheet, ensuring the first tab contains the primary key.

**2. Create a Gmail draft template:**

In Gmail, create a draft email with placeholders (e.g., {{First Name}}, {{Last Name}}) that correspond to the columns in your spreadsheet.

**4. Start Mail Merge:**

Click on “Start Mail Merge”, Select your Gmail draft template in “Email Template”, and hit “Send emails” button. It will directly fetch the data from the Excel sheet and use your Gmail draft template. (I can see only (Send 2 emails) option as I have only 2 sample rows in my excel sheet. It depends on how much data you have in your sheet.

**And the Best Part is, we can track the email which we have sent.** Here’s how:
